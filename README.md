##  How to ues it
 you can download this project.And open in your own AndroidStudio.In your AS,you need a sqlite database in it.if you do not have it.you should make it first
 ## What i have done
 In this application, we mainly have two view to show.
 
One is a brief introduction of the display view, that is the main view,  When the interface is without a project, it will display an empty view. the main view contains a reusable list of the items that can be displayed. The list is clicked on the "BUY" button to modify the number of the book. The right - foot suspension button can be edited into the detailed interface. And click list item can also enter the book project under the book to modify the information.

## Which technology i have used
In the project, I used the function callback and use Android to create and connect the database, using the list that can retrieve the view.
